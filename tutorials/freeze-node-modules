# Motivation

1. Just maintaining the node_modules versions in `package.json` is not enough because sometimes npm downloads the latest minor versions
from the npm registry when npm install is run and it is not safe because some of updates in libs might break the application and we will never know
what broke the application. So it becomes necessary to freeze the node_modules version.

# How to freeze node_modules versions

One of the way to freeze node_modules version is using `npm shrinkwrap`

Assuming that you have all node_modules installed on your system within `node_modules/` directory.

run the command
```
npm shrinkwrap
```

This file will generate file named `npm-shrinkwrap.json`. just check in this file and you are done!!
